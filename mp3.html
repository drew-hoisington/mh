<h1>Mini-Project 3: Digital Audio</h1>

<h2>What You Will Hear</h2>
<p>This audio file is an introduction to who I am as an educator and family man. I will use this file in my e-Portfolio as an introduction to my page and artifact of my work in this Multimedia / Hypermedia course. </p>

<h2>Creating and Editing My Audio File</h2>
<p>I downloaded two tracks from Bensound and used them throughout my audio track. I uploaded the first sound track and recorded my first audio section over it. I then faded out the sound track after cutting it to the desired length. Then, I imported the second sound track and faded it in. After cutting the track to the the desired length, I recorded my second audio track and faded out the sound track at the the conclusion of the audio file.</p>
