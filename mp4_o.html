<p>For this assignment, I was able to validate 2 of the 3 pages. Page #1 (mp1) only had 2 error messages and those were and easy fix. Page #2 (mp2) had 17 errors when I ran it through the validator and they were small mistakes that could be fixed by closing tags and getting rid of spaces that I had left by accident. Page 3 (mp3) is still a work in progress. It started with 18 errors and I still am unable to fix 5 of them. It keeps saying I have "unidentified elements" and "no attributes" for my audio. However, when I remove the items it tells me to, the audio disappears and then I have 6 errors instead of 5. I worked for hours to try and rectify the issues but have since lost the ways I was trying to fix it. Looking back, I probably should have wrote the ways I had tried to fix it because I was choosing to change it in ways I had already tried.</p>
