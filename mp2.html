 <h1>Mini-Project 2: Digital Text & Image</h1>
 
<h2>Image Set #1</h2>
<p>This image was taken in Spring 2019 after an addition of turf to our baseball field. I decided to use this image as the backdrop for our annual 2019 Summer Baseball Camp flyer. I took this photo on an iPhone 7 and uploaded it to my computer. Using Photoshop, I enhanced the image by increasing the brightness, saturation, and adding a new layer with a soft edge.<p/>

<h2>Image Set #2</h2>
<p>This image was pulled from Google Images and created to show parents/guardians where drop off and check-in was located and also the location of the Varsity Field. I chose this image that was captured by a drone from above our high school and used Photoshop to enhance the image. A content aware fill as used to remove the green circles. Then the shape tool was used to create arrows and finally the type tool to add labels.<p/>
